This is the version we have reached.

Things I am happy with:
- I managed to create a decent architecture for the store part.
- The code is relatively clean given the speed of work.

Areas that could be improved:
- The application has some bugs because I didn't have time to handle all the data in the store after each modification made (having pagination seemed to increase the complexity of maintaining correct data).
- Instead of using a modal, I could have navigated to a new page, which would have introduced routing as well.
- I haven't implemented linting
